Every variable in javascript is in essence a reference.

Most engines optimize the storage of various primitives,
such that the reference's value is the value of the primitive itself.

They do this by tagging the reference to indicate that it is to be interpreted as a primitive value rather than a pointer.

That all being said.

The Garbage Collector when doing a marking phase of the "mark and sweep" algorithm still needs to
visit the primitive variables in order to confirm that they are tagged as a primitive.

The overhead of checking whether a variable is a primitive, then moving on to the next variable;
is less than that of if it were an object which then would require further visiting of the child nodes.
BUT even though it is less, this overhead is not zero.

This is VERY LIKELY over optimization. I wanted to try it nevertheless.
So, by allocating a Uint*Array, I can create a single reference that the garbage collector needs to check.
It sees that the children of that Uint*Array are primitive values, and thus it doesn't have to visit the children.
Thus 64 number variables, that would've been 64 visits during the marking phase of GC, become just 1 visit.


The next thing I'm doing is referring to these Uint*Array members by name through the use of const fat arrow functions.
I want to avoid the cost of invoking these const fat arrow functions, and remove the cost of their definitions.
The first statement needs to be that a JS engine might actually do what this file does at runtime through
their own inlining, or caching. But I wanted to ensure it occured in a way that felt confidently in control of.

So to have complete control over the inlining of some state I define const fat arrow functions that have an expression body.
I then use babel to replace all invocations of these fat arrow functions as the expression body itself.
Furthermore babel removes the definition of the const fat arrow function from the AST entirely so there is literally 0 overhead,
it is as if I typed the expression body everywhere I typed the fat arrow function when it comes to the end compiled file.
